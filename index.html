      <hr id="line">
        <p id="subtext">
          Hi! If you are reading this, then you've probably been invited to an Entrepreneurial Mastermind! </br>

        </p>

        <p id="bodytext">
          ... But maybe you are wondering <i>what is a Mastermind?</i>, and.... <i>why the heck would I join one!?</i> </br></br>


          A mastermind is a group of like minded people that comes together regularly - usually about once a week, or once every two weeks - with the sole purpose of helping each other become more successful.

          </br></br>The Mastermind was brought to fame by the all-time-classic book '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_and_Grow_Rich">Think and Grow Rich</a>' by Napoleon Hill.

          In this classic book about how to become successful Hill states <i>''no individual may have great power without availing himself to the Mastermind group''</i>.
          </p>
          <h5 class="header">The procedure</h5>
          <p id="bodytext">

            The Idea of this particular Mastermind is as follows:</br></br>We come together (with 6 ~ 10 people) for about 1,5 hours with a group of people who are all entrepreneurs. The intention of the Mastermind is to increase business succes of all of it's participants.

          </br></br>The format of the sessions follows the following protocol:</br></br>

            One person in the group states the biggest problem and the biggest opportunity that is currently occurring in his/her business.

          </br></br>The rest of the group then spends the remainder of the session suggesting him/her the best ways to deal with the problem and to seize the opportunity.

        </br></br>In the next session another person will be in 'The Hotseat'.

      </br></br>After the session we send you the notes of the most important things that were said, and we plan the next Mastermind.

            </br></br>This particular method of doing the Mastermind comes from <a href="https://ebenpagantraining.com/">Eben Pagan</a>. The method is tried and tested, and has been used countless times to create amazing results for the people involved.

          </p>

          <h5 class="header">Where/When</h5>
          <p id="bodytext">

          The comming Mastermind session will be held before the end of September at WeWork (Weesperstraat 61).
        </br></br>We'll facilitate everything surrounding the Mastermind, you simply have to show up!
        </br></br>
        The Mastermind is an ongoing event, but of course you don't commit yourself to joining it long term by accepting this invitation.
You can simply join one session, and then see how you would like to continue.

        </p>
        <h5 class="header">Grand Conclusion</h5>
